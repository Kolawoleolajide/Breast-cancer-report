## 🧠 Project Overview
This project analyzes a real-world **Breast Cancer patient dataset** to uncover insights about survival outcomes, tumor characteristics, and patient demographics.  
The goal is to provide a data-driven understanding of **factors that influence survival rate**, helping health organizations focus on early detection and awareness.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes 16 columns and 4,000+ patient records with variables such as:

- **Age, Race, Marital Status**  
- **Tumor Stage (T Stage, N Stage, 6th Stage)**  
- **Tumor Size, Grade, Differentiation**  
- **Hormone Receptor Status (Estrogen / Progesterone)**  
- **Survival Months & Status (Alive / Dead)**

---

## 🎯 Key Metrics (DAX Measures)
- **Total Patients**  
- **Average Survival Duration (Months)**  
- **Survival Rate (%)**  
- **Average Tumor Size**  
- **Stage Distribution (%)**  
- **Positive Hormone Receptor %**

---

## 📈 Key Insights
1. **Age vs. Survival Duration:**  
   Women aged **40–49** have the **highest average survival rate (72.7 months)**.

2. **Tumor Size Impact:**  
   Larger tumors correlate with **lower survival rates**, showing the need for **early detection**.

3. **Stage & Survival Relationship:**  
   Patients at **T1 stage** have a **90.23% survival rate**, confirming that **early diagnosis saves lives**.

4. **Hormone Receptor Status:**  
   Patients with **positive Estrogen/Progesterone** receptors show **better survival outcomes**.

5. **Demographic Effects:**  
   - **Married women** have higher survival rates.  
   - **White race** recorded the highest number of cases, while **“Other” races** showed the best survival rate (**89%**).
